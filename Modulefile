summary 'Puppet module that implements the constraint type'
description 'The constraint type aims to lift the need for both
  the defined() and ensure_resource() functions. Each constraint
  defines a set of allowed and/or forbidden resource properties, e.g.

    constraint {
      "foo": resource   => Package["apache2"],
             properties => { ensure => present };
    }

  See README.md for more examples.'
